# Portfolio V2.2 — Dark + Project Details + 3D in detail page

- Cards show the first image from `images[]` as preview.
- Clicking a card opens `project.html?slug=...` which renders:
  - Big 3D viewer (if `model` is provided),
  - Image gallery,
  - Long description.
- Add more images by saving them in /assets and appending paths to the project's `images` array.
