# Esteban Caicedo – Engineering Portfolio (code-only pack)

This pack contains ONLY the site code (no `assets/` and no `projects.json`), so you can
drop it into your repo without touching your existing assets folder or your data file.

Included:
- index.html
- project.html
- style.css
- README.md (this file)

How to use:
1) In GitHub: **Add file → Upload files**, and drag these four files to the repo root.
2) Commit e.g. `v2.4.3 — code-only refresh (keep existing assets & projects.json)`.
3) Your current `assets/` and `projects.json` remain intact.
